= The Acts As Taggable Extended
The aptly named 'acts_as_taggable_extended' plugin extends the
acts_as_taggable gem originally created by DH2.

= Why YAAATP?
DH2 who created the "Official" ActsAsTaggable (AAT) plugin
deprecated it and is no longer supporting or recommending it for 
use in Rails projects going forward. However, much of AAT worked
fine and over the years has been extended or improved in a variety
of ways. 

This extension originally just sat on top of the existing AAT plugin
and automatically extended the plugin during runtime. However, now
that DH2 deprecated AAT I've decided to roll the existing source into
the extension's code base thereby making it independent from the
original AAT code.

== Installation

gem install acts_as_taggable_extended

Be sure to include the plugin in your 'config/environment.rb' file:

require_gem 'acts_as_taggable_extended'

== Usage Instructions


== TODO
1. Extend the generator to take a param of models that are to become taggable
2. Extend the migration to take the taggable models and add the tag_aggregate field.
3. Extend the spec tests to incorporate fixtures provided for testing the
tags using the taggable models.
