69||full_access|The Boston Globe (and Boston Sunday Globe) is the most widely circulated daily newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts and New England. Owned by The New York Times Company, the broadsheet Globe's local print rival is the tabloid Boston Herald.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Globe was founded in 1872 by six Boston businessmen, led by Eben Jordan, who jointly invested $150,000. The first issue was published March 4, 1872 and cost four cents. It was originally a morning daily when it began Sunday publication in 1877. In 1878, The Globe started an afternoon edition called The Boston Evening Globe, which ceased publication in 1979.\r\n\r\nThe Globe was a private company until 1973 when it went public under the name Affiliated Publications. It continued to be managed by the descendants of Charles H. Taylor. In 1993, The New York Times Company purchased Affiliated Publications for US$1.1 million, making The Globe a wholly-owned subsidiary of The New York Times' parent.[3] The Jordan and Taylor families received substantial Times Company stock, but the last Taylor family members left management in 2000-2001.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, columnist Patricia Smith was forced to resign after it was discovered that she had fabricated people and quotations in several of her columns.[4] This raised questions of a double standard at the Globe, as Mike Barnicle, who is white (Smith is African-American), had been accused of the same offense without being punished. In August of that year, Barnicle was discovered to have copied material for a column from a George Carlin book, Brain Droppings. He was suspended for this offense, and his past columns were reviewed. In their review, the Globe editors found that Barnicle had fabricated a story about two cancer patients, and Barnicle was forced to resign.[5]\r\n\r\nGlobe reporters were an instrumental part of uncovering the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in 2001-2003, especially in relation to Massachusetts churches. They were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for their work, one of several the paper has received for its outstanding investigative journalism.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2005, the Globe retracted a story describing the events of a seal hunt near Halifax, Nova Scotia that took place on April 12, 2005. Written by freelancer Barbara Stewart, a former New York Times staffer, the article described the specific number of boats involved in the hunt and graphically described the killing of seals and the protests that accompanied it. In reality, weather had delayed the hunt, which had not yet begun the day the story had been filed, so the details were fabricated. [6][7]\r\n\r\nThe Globe is also credited with allowing Peter Gammons to start his Notes section on baseball, which has become a mainstay in all major newspapers nation wide. Gammons went on to become a member of the Baseball Writers Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Charlie Savage, whose reports on President Bush's use of signing statements made national news, won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.\r\n\r\nToday, The Globe now hosts 28 blogs covering a variety of topics including Boston sports, local politics and a blog made up of posts from the paper's opinion writers.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Globe|Wikipedia||The New York Times Company|The New York Times Company||||Boston|US|MA||international|english||||||hide|list|neutral|

Created by an act of Parliament, the news cooperative was formed to help newspapers cover and distribute news across the vast country. Initially operating as a distribution network, its first editorial staff came on board during World War I to report on the efforts of Canadian soldiers overseas. With the arrival of television and radio, The Canadian Press branched out to deliver text specifically written for broadcasters, as well as the production of newscasts, and audio clips. The Canadian Press operates in both English and French, Canada's official languages. The French Service was established in 1951. It has bureaus across Canada and correspondents in Washington, DC. The news agency operated a bureau in London, England, until 2004, and has had reporters covering the Canadian mission in Afghanistan since 2002. The Canadian Press is a private not-for-profit cooperative, owned and operated by its member newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Press also operates the largest online editorial archive of news pictures capturing Canada, its people and history, shot by its award-winning photojournalists. It was the first in Canada to develop this online archive in 1996 and now it is home to over two million digital images with hundreds of images added each day. These photos appear in newspapers, books and magazines, and online.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing news to newspapers, TV and radio, The Canadian Press is Canadas leading provider of online news and photos. It was a pioneer in introducing this online breaking news service in 1996 and now its multimedia content is published by all major Canadian news websites.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, The Canadian Press launched breaking news video, produced specifically for websites and wireless services. More than 70 reporters (and growing) across Canada are equipped with the latest digital cameras to film exclusive footage only seen online.\r\n\r\nThrough a longstanding partnership, The Canadian Press is the exclusive distributor of Associated Press (AP) and Associated Press Television News (APTN) material in Canada. AP and APTN is the exclusive distributor of The Canadian Press in the United States and worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to news and information, The Canadian Press publishes the Stylebook and Caps and Spelling book, which are considered the chief style guides for Canadian journalists, public relations professionals, editors and writers of all disciplines.\r\n\r\nThrough an alliance with The Canadian Press since 2004, Marketwire is the only news release distributor with exclusive access to send press releases and PR photos on behalf of clients over the same Canadian Press Wire Network used to deliver Canadian Press news copy directly into the editorial systems of more than 600 newspapers, radio and TV stations and websites across Canada.\r\n\r\nThe focus of The Canadian Press remains firmly fixed on telling the Canadian story.

While at one time reporters were drawn largely from church members, this no longer holds true. (...) The Monitor (or "CSM" as it is known in the intelligence community) is widely read by CIA and other intelligence agency analysts because of the newspaper's attention to accuracy and global perspective.[citation needed]. Project Censored noted that the Monitor often publishes factual articles discussing topics under-represented or absent from the mainstream mass media. In comparison to other major newspapers and journalistic magazines, the Monitor tends to take a steady and slightly upbeat approach to national and world news. Many readers prefer the Monitor because it avoids sensationalism, particularly with respect to tragedies, and for its objectivity and integrity; at the same time, the paper's staff does operate under the close eye of the church's five-member board of directors, and has sometimes been seen as avoiding issues that involve the church in controversial and unfavorable ways.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science_Monitor|Wikipedia||Jonathan Wells|The Christian Science Publishing Society, Mary Trammel||||Boston|US|MA||international|english||||||hide|list|neutral|

159||full_access|The Daily Mail is a British newspaper and the oldest tabloid, first published in 1896. It is Britain's second biggest-selling daily newspaper after The Sun and arguably the most conservative in viewpoint. Its sister paper, the Mail on Sunday was launched in 1982, and an Irish version of the paper was launched on 6 February 2006. The Daily Mail was Britain's first daily newspaper aimed at what is now considered the middle-market and the first to sell 1 million copies a day. The Daily Mail is often criticised and poked fun at on many TV shows for its often xenophobic and casually racist style of writing.\r\nThe Mail was originally a broadsheet, but switched to its current tabloid format on 3 May 1971, on the 75th anniversary of its founding (on this date it also absorbed the Daily Sketch, which had previously been published as a tabloid by the same company). Its long-standing rival, the Daily Express, has a broadly similar political stance and target readership, but nowadays sells one-third the number of copies. Since 2005, the publisher of the Mail, the Daily Mail and General Trust, has been a FTSE 100 company, and the paper has a circulation of more than two million, giving it one of the largest circulations of any English language daily newspaper, and the twelfth highest of any newspaper in the world.\r\nThe Daily Mail tries to occupy a position midway between the tabloid and broadsheet divide, covering much of the same celebrity ground as the tabloids but attempting to position itself as a more upmarket "middle class" publication.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail|Wikipedia||||||||GB||||english||||||hide||right|

It was founded in 1952 by the publisher Kamel Mrowa--who already owned and edited the Arabic daily Al-Hayat--to serve the growing number of expatriates brought by the oil industry. First circulating in Lebanon, and then expanding throughout the region, it not only relayed news about foreign workers' home countries, but also served to keep them informed about the region. By the 1960s it was the leading English language newspaper in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mrowa in 1966, his widow Salma Elbissar took over the paper, running it until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War forced the suspension of publication. With peace hopes running high in the beginning of 1983, the paper restarted production under the guidance of Mrowa's sons, but the intensification of the war again put the paper under pressure. The flight of the intelligensia from the country depleted the paper's staff and its readership. Still, it continued as a daily until mid 1985 and then as a weekly for another year, before ceasing publication once again.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Star_%28Lebanon%29|Wikipedia||||||||||||english||||||hide|list|center|

It has been in continuous publication since James Wilson established it in September 1843. As of summer 2007, its average circulation topped 1.2 million copies a week, about half of which are sold in North America. Consequently it is often seen as a transatlantic (as opposed to solely British) news source.\r\n\r\nThe aim of The Economist is "to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress." Subjects covered include international news, economics, politics, business, finance, science, technology, and the arts. The publication is targeted at the high-end "prestige" segment of the market and counts among its audience influential business and government decision-makers.\r\n\r\nIt takes a strongly argued editorial stance on many issues, especially its support for free trade and fiscal conservatism; it can thus be considered as a magazine which practises advocacy journalism.\r\n\r\nAlthough The Economist calls itself a newspaper and refers to its staff as correspondents, it is printed in magazine form on glossy paper, like a newsmagazine.\r\n\r\nThe Economist belongs to The Economist Group. The publication interests of the group include the CFO brand family as well as the annual World in..., the lifestyle quarterly Intelligent Life, European Voice and Roll Call (known as "the Newspaper of Capitol Hill"). Another part of the group is The Economist Intelligence Unit, a research and advisory company providing country, industry and management analysis worldwide. Since 1928, half the shares of The Economist Group have been owned by the Financial Times, a subsidiary of Pearson PLC, and the other half by a group of independent shareholders, including many members of the staff.

235||full_access|A Gallup Poll is an opinion poll conducted by The Gallup Organization and frequently used by the mass media for representing public opinion. The Gallup Poll is named after its inventor, the American statistician George Gallup. Until the mid 1980's the Gallup poll conducted its polls using door-to-door sampling methods. Now, however, nearly all samples are chosen using the process of "random digit dialing". ("How Polls are Conducted", an excerpt from Where America Stands by Michael Golay, 1997)\r\n\r\nThe Gallup Poll has existed since the 1930s. Historically, The Gallup Organization has measured and tracked the public's attitudes concerning virtually every political, social, and economic issue of the day, including highly sensitive or controversial subjects. Although Gallup has typically conducted its polling activities in collaboration with various media organizations and, on occasion, with worldwide associations and academic institutions, these polls are reputed to have been carried out independently and objectively.\r\n\r\nGallup Polls are usually accurate in predicting the correct outcome of the Presidential election. A notable exception is the 1948 Dewey-Truman election, where nearly all pollsters predicted a Dewey victory. The Gallup Poll also predicted a slim victory by Ford in 1976. Gallup was technically correct in the 2000 poll, although George W. Bush did not receive the majority vote.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_poll|Wikipedia|||||||||||national|english||||||hide|list|neutral|

It is attributed to Labor Zionism and occasionally post-Zionism.\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict tends to publish more views sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than other Israeli newspapers, as shown by the reporting of Amira Hass and, to a lesser extent, Gideon Levy. Haaretz strongly supported the Oslo Accords with the PLO. The position of the newspaper in Israel's religious spectrum is decidedly secular. Although space is often given to issues of social justice (exemplified by Ruth Sinai's frequent columns on this topic), the paper's editorial line on economic issues is primarily classical-liberal in the spirit of The Economist.

Because of the prominence and access of its contributors, the HuffPost regularly publishes scoops of current news stories, otherwise providing links to selected prominent news stories, providing a left-of-center counterpoint to the link-heavy style of The Drudge Report. Compared to other left-wing blogs such as the expertise-heavy Znet or the long-established Daily Kos, the HuffPost draws a balance between hard news commentary and coverage, popular culture and celebrity opinion features. It is also known for the wide range of opinions expressed by members of the public who are encouraged to comment on the original articles.

MSNBC is currently America's third most-watched cable news channel [1], after Fox News, and CNN, but ahead of CNBC and CNN Headline News. It is available in 83.6 million households in the U.S. and broadcasts primarily out of its studios in Secaucus, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nCurrently, MSNBC is a mix of opinion hosts from across the political spectrum:Chris Matthews leans to the left, although he admittedly supported George W. Bush for president, was a former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter; while Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, and Tucker Carlson are solidly on the right. Opinion is combined with rolling news coverage during the day.\r\n\r\nMSNBC was founded by Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit, which is now NBC Universal. Although Microsoft and NBC shared operations of the venture at its founding, it was announced on December 23, 2005 that NBC Universal will purchase a majority stake in the television network, leaving Microsoft with 18%.

381||full_access|Nature is one of the most prominent scientific journals, first published on 4 November 1869. Although most scientific journals are now highly specialized, Nature is idiosyncratic (along with other weekly journals such as Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) in still publishing original research articles across a wide range of scientific fields. In most fields of scientific research, many of the most important new advances each year are published as articles in Nature while significant work published elsewhere is often reported in Nature as letters.\r\n\r\nResearch scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but article summaries and accompanying articles make many of the most important articles understandable for the general public and to scientists in other fields. Toward the front of each issue are editorials and news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research articles which are often dense and highly technical. Due to strict limits on the length of articles, in many cases the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying supplemental material on the journal's website.\r\n\r\nNature was first established in the United Kingdom in 1869 by Sir Norman Lockyer. Prior to the existence of Nature several scientific journals were in circulation in the United Kingdom, including the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which is one of the world's longest running scientific journals. The relatively progressive, controversial nature of the journals first articles and writers may have contributed to its success, as many early publications included evolutionary theory and Darwinism, at the time a divisive issue due to its radical nature and its religious implications.[1] Former editor Sir John Maddox has suggested that it was Natures more journalistic style of writing and publication that allowed for its triumph.[2]|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_magazine|Wikipedia||||private_corporation|||||||international|english||||||hide|||

It began as the Seattle Press-Times, a four-page newspaper founded in 1891 with a daily circulation of 3,500, which Maine teacher and attorney Alden J. Blethen bought in 1896. Renamed the Seattle Daily Times, it doubled its circulation within half a year. By 1915, circulation stood at 70,000. As of September 2005, weekday circulation stood at 215,502.\r\n\r\nThe Times is one of the few remaining major city dailies in the United States to be independently operated and owned by a local family (the Blethens). Knight Ridder owns a 49.5 percent stake in the paper.\r\n\r\nSince 1983, the Times and the Hearst-owned Seattle Post-Intelligencer are run under a "Joint Operating Agreement" (JOA) whereby advertising, production, marketing, and circulation are run by the Times for both papers. They maintain separate news and editorial departments. The papers put out a combined Sunday edition, whose circulation is 469,853, to which the P-I contributes only a few pages of editorial content. The Times tried to cancel the JOA in 2003, citing a clause in the JOA that three consecutive years of profit losses were cause for cancelling the agreement. Hearst disagreed, arguing that a force majeure clause prevents the Times from claiming losses as reason to end the JOA when they result from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven week newspaper strike). Each side publicly accused each other of attempting to put its rival out of business, and Hearst soon filed suit. After several appeals, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Times on June 30, 2005, a decision that could determine the future of both papers. Hearst promises more suits to challenge other aspects of the Times' attempt to pull out of the JOA.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Times|Wikipedia||||||||||||english||||||hide|list|center|

Though nonpartisan, the publication has historically been an advocate for liberal political policies.

The publication continues this mission through today by focusing on covering what the mainstream press does not.[2]\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Observer broke[3] the story of an allegedly crooked narcotics investigation in Tulia, Texas, that led to front-page coverage in The New York Times and other national news outlets. Tom Coleman, the narcotics investigator in the tiny town, was eventually accused of trumping up drug bust information, mostly aimed at African Americans. Coleman claimed he had made more than 100 undercover drug purchases from 46 different drug dealers (40 of whom were black). About a dozen of the accused were sentenced, some for up to 90 years (based almost entirely on his personal accounts with virtually no corroborating evidence) before authorities stopped to investigate Coleman's practices, largely due to the Observer's reporting.[4] Coleman was found guilty of one charge of perjury, for which he was sentenced to seven years probation.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Observer|Wikipedia||||nonprofit_organization|||Austin|US||||english||||||hide||center|

671|The Washington Post|full_access|The Washington Post is the largest and most circulated newspaper in Washington, D.C. It is also one of the city's oldest papers, founded in 1877. It is widely considered to be one of the most important newspapers in the United States due to its particular emphasis on national politics, and international affairs, and being a newspaper of record. Even so, the Washington Post has always been defined as a local paper and does not print any editions for the outside region beyond that of the D.C., Maryland, or Virginia editions for daily circulation.\r\nThe newspaper is published as a broadsheet, with photographs printed both in color as well as in black and white. Weekday printings include the main section, containing the first page, national, international news, politics, and editorials and opinions, followed by the sections on local news (Metro), sports, business, style (feature writing on pop culture, politics, fine and performing arts, film, fashion, and gossip), and classifieds.\r\nThe Sunday edition includes the weekday sections as well as several weekly sections: Outlook (opinion and editorials), Style & Arts, Sunday Source, Travel, Bookworld, Comics, TV Week, and the Washington Post Magazine. Beyond the newspaper, the Washington Post under its parent company of The Washington Post Company is involved with the Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive and Washingtonpost.com.\r\nIn 1889, John Phillip Sousa composed on behalf of the newspaper "The Washington Post March", which later became one of the most famous march music pieces. Perhaps the most notable incident in the Post's history was when, in the early 1970s, reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein began the media's investigation of Watergate. This contributed greatly to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. In later years, its investigative reporting has led to increased review of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\r\nSince Leonard Downie, Jr. was named executive editor in 1991, the Post has won 25 Pulitzer Prizes, more than half of the paper's total collection of 47 Pulitzers awarded. This includes six separate Pulitzers given in 2008, the second-highest record of Pulitzers ever given to a single newspaper in one year.[2] The Post has also received 18 Nieman Fellowships, and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards, among others.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post|Wikipedia|Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, Anne Applebaum,  Herb Block,  Thomas Boswell,  David Broder,  Tina Brown,  Art Buchwald,  Chris Cillizza,  Richard L.
