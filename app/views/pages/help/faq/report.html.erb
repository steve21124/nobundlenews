<p><a name="what_is_report"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What is a report?</span>
A <%=app_name%> report is an online scorecard which presents our findings about a news story or source. In the beta phase, <%=app_name%> will offer two different types of reports: Story Reports and Source Reports (see below).</p>
<p><a name="what_is_story_report"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What is a story report?</span>
A story report is an online scorecard that presents our findings about a news story. Each story on our site has a Story Report, which is available to all members and can be read by clicking any story title. This takes you to our report's Overview page (also called &quot;About this Story&quot;). For more information about story reports, see below.</p>

<p><a name="what_is_source_report"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What is a source report?</span>
A source report is an online scorecard that presents our findings about a news source (e.g. a news publication or author). We will soon offer the first version of our Source Report (based on all sources reviewed for each source). Most sources on our site have a simple Source Report, which you can read by clicking on their source name. This takes you to our report's Overview page, which presents our findings about this source (also called &quot;About this Source &quot;). For more information about source reports, see below.</p>
<p><a name="what_is_story_listing"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What is a story listing?</span>
A story listing displays stories in ranked order, usually by average rating or date. Story listings can be general, or about specific topics or source types. Clicking on any story title takes you to the corresponding story report. Clicking on &quot;Rate It&quot; takes you to the review form for that story. For more information about story reports, see below.</p>
<p><a name="what_is_source_listing"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What is a source listing?</span>
A sources listing displays sources in ranked order, usually by average rating from all the stories we've rated to date. Source listings can be general, or about specific source types or viewpoint. Clicking on any source title takes you to the corresponding source report. For more information about source reports, see below.</p>

<p><a name="suggestions_problems"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">How can I make a suggestion or report a problem?</span>

<p><a name="check_story"></a><a name="read_story"><a name="story_report" id="story_report"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Story Report</span>
A story report is an online scorecard that presents our findings about a news story. Each story on our site has a Story Report, which is available to all members and can be read by clicking any story title. This takes you to our report's Overview page (also called &quot;About this Story&quot;). There, you can see a short summary about this story, along with our report's key findings.</p>
<p>
Each Story Report page has a gray action bar below the main summary, which lets you view the full story, review it or edit its report. To view the full story, click on &quot;Full Story&quot; in the gray action bar. To review or rate the story, click on &quot;Review this Story&quot; in the gray action bar (see <a href="/heop/faq/reviewer" target="_blank">Reviewer FAQ</a>). If you're a host, you can also edit a Story Report by clicking on &quot;Edit this Report &quot; in the story action bar   (see <a href="/help/faq/host/" target="_blank">Host FAQ</a>).</p>
<p><a name="story_title"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Story Title</span>
Each Story Report begins with a story title, at the top of the page. If the story did not have a title, we feature the first sentence of the story. Story titles that exceed 80 characters may be truncated.</p>
<p><a name="story_main_publication"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Publication</span>
The Story Report also features the name of the original publication for this story. Some publication names may be linked to their <%=app_name%> source report. If more than one publication originally published this story, other publication names may be included in the tag section below the gray action bar.</p>
<p><a name="story_author_names"></a><a name="journalist_names"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Authors</span>
When available, we also feature the names of the journalists that originally authored this story. An author can be a writer, reporter, host, photographer, editor or other significant contributor to this story.</p>
<p><a name="story_date"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Story Date</span>
Each story report features its story's original publication date (or nearest release date). Since stories are constantly updated online, this date may no longer match the latest version date.</p>
<p><a name="full_story"></a><a name="story_url_main"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Full Story</span>
To see the full story featured in a report, click on &quot;Full Story&quot; next to its date or in the story action bar. This will open a new window, showing the story in its original website. If the story does not appear in that window, please email us right away at <%= mail_to email_addr("help"), email_addr("help"), :subject => "#{app_name} help request", :encode => "javascript" %>. One of the reasons we show stories in a separate window is to protect the copyrights of their owners.</p>
<p><a name="story_online_access"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Online Access</span>
If a story has limited online access (e.g., if it requires a free or paid subscription), we try to indicate its status next to the story title in the story overview page. If a story does not appear to be available online, please email us right away at <%= mail_to email_addr("help"), email_addr("help"), :subject => "#{app_name} help request", :encode => "javascript" %>, so we may remove it from our story listings.</p>
<p><a name="story_quote"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Story Quote</span>
Each story report also features a short quote or description. Quotes that exceed 100 words may be truncated.</p>
<p><a name="review_this_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Review this Story</span>
To review a story, click on the yellow "Review this Story" button on any story report. This will open the story on the news site, along with our toolbar and review form. (In some cases, the story and our review form will show in separate windows, for news sites that do not support our toolbar). Follow the instructions on the review form (or check our <%= link_to 'Reviewer FAQ', "/help/faq/reviewer/" + (params[:popup] ? "?popup=true" : "") %><a href="/help/faq/" class="subhead_plain"></a>).</p><span class="back_top"><hr><a href="#top" class="subhead_plain">Back to Top</a></span>
<p><a name="story_overview" id="story_overview"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Story Overview</span>
The Overview page of a story report shows our collective findings about this story, right below the gray action bar. For detailed help about any finding, click on its title in the left column, or keep reading this FAQ. To go to another page of a story report, click on any title in the report navbar (below the gray action bar).</p>
<p>
Once you have read a Story Overview, you can find out more about that story in these additional report pages: Reviews, Ratings, Tags, Research, and Improvements (see below). To see any of these pages,  click on their titles in the report navbar (below the gray action bar). To see all reviews on a single page, click on "Reviews." To go back to the Story Overview, click on &quot;Overview.&quot; You can also step through each report page with the "Next" and "Previous" arrows.</p><span class="back_top"><hr><a href="#top" class="subhead_plain">Back to Top</a></span>
<p><a name="story_reviews" id="story_reviews"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Story Reviews</span>
The Reviews section of a story report shows at a glance all our reviews for this story. Each review is summarized here, only showing key findings from each member. To see that member's story review, click on &quot;full review&quot; or &quot;(review)&quot; next to their name. To see that member's profile, click on their name.</p>
<p>
For details about story reviews, keep reading, or check our <%= link_to 'Reviewer FAQ', "/help/faq/reviewer/" + (params[:popup] ? "?popup=true" : "") %><a href="/help/faq/" class="subhead_plain"></a>. Note that we do not list reviews with no overall rating, or reviews that violate our terms of service.</p>
<p><a name="story_featured_reviews"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Featured Reviews</span>
Our story reports often feature story reviews from our members, if available. Featured reviews are typically selected by a <%=app_name%> host or staff member. These reviews are shown here in summary form. To see a member's full story review,  click on &quot;full review&quot; or &quot;(review)&quot; next to their name. To see that member's profile, click on their name.</p>
<p><a name="story_full_reviews"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Full Reviews</span>
Our story reviews page groups full reviews together, if available. Full review forms include a wide range of rating questions, and let reviewers tag, research or improve the story. These reviews are shown here in summary form. To see a member's full story review,  click on &quot;full review&quot; or &quot;(review)&quot; next to their name. To see that member's profile, click on their name.</p>
<p><a name="story_quick_reviews"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Quick Reviews</span>
Our story reviews page groups quick reviews and mini reviews together, if available. Quick review forms only include a few rating questions and tags. Mini review forms only include two questions about the selected story (Recommendation and Comments). These reviews are shown here in summary form. To see a member's full story review,  click on &quot;full review&quot; or &quot;(review)&quot; next to their name. To see that member's profile, click on their name.</p>
<p><a name="story_comments"></a><a name="overall_comments"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Comments</span>
Each story review starts with the reviewer's comments, if any. Reviewers are invited to write about the journalistic quality of the story, and explain why they gave it their ratings, in 250 words or less. We ask that comments be civil, thoughtful, concise, and respectful of others, in compliance with our <a href="/help/faq/#community_questions" target="_blank">community guidelines</a>. If you find a comment that is clearly offensive or otherwise violates our guidelines, please report it by clicking on &quot;Report a Problem.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="story_rating_variance"></a><a name="variance"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Rating Variance</span>
Individual story review pages show the variance between a member's story ratings and ratings from all members. This variance is shown to the right of that member's star ratings for that story. Variance is expressed as a positive or negative percentage, indicating how much this reviewer's rating differs from the member average. This variance can be helpful when rating a review, as it can reveal possible inconsistencies between a single reviewer and the rest of the group. A high variance is not necessarily a bad sign, but it is worth noting. See below.</p>
<p><a name="rate_this_review"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Rate this Review</span>
To rate a member's story review, click on the appropriate rating number next to "Rate this Review" (at the bottom of that member's review). Reviews are rated on the scale of 1 to 5, based on their overall helpfulness (1 = not helpful at all &gt;&gt; 5 = very helpful). A review's helpfulness is typically associated with the same basic journalistic principles we look for in news stories, as well as our own <a href="/help/faq/#community_questions" target="_blank">community guidelines</a>. We're not asking if you agree with this review, but whether it is helpful, thoughtful, respectful and informative. Once a review has been rated, an overall review rating is shown to the right, along with the total number of members who rated this review. This overall review rating averages your own rating with other member ratings of this review. Please rate carefully, as these review ratings form an important part of a <%=app_name%> member's average rating (see our member rating section for more information). If you find a review that is clearly offensive or otherwise violates our guidelines, please report it by clicking on &quot;Report a Problem.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="member_rating"></a><a name="member_weight_average"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Member Weight Average</span>
<%=app_name%> story ratings are averaged based on Member Weights. Each time a member
reviews a story, a Member Weight is calculated based on that member's level, knowledge
of that topic, number of questions answered, and how other members have rated this
story review (see above). That Member Weight is then used to weigh that member's
individual story rating, to determine a group Story Rating average. The intent of that
Member Weight is to give more importance to ratings from our most trusted and
knowledgeable members, as well as members who have done more detailed reviews than
others.
</p><span class="back_top"><hr><a href="#top" class="subhead_plain">Back to Top</a></span>
<p><a name="story_rating_questions"></a><a name="story_ratings"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Story Ratings</span>
The Ratings section of a story report shows at a glance what our members think about the journalistic quality of this story. Story ratings are inspired by important principles of journalism (e.g., fairness, accuracy), based on codes of ethics from respected news organizations. Using our review forms, our members evaluate each story for these different criteria, on a scale of 1 to 5 (e.g. Fairness: 1 = not fair at all &gt;&gt; 5 = very fair).</p>
<p><em>PRELIMINARY DATA DISCLAIMER: All Story Ratings on this beta site are based on preliminary data from a small number of reviewers. As such, they may not yet be accurate, and are shown here for demonstration purposes only. Once we've tested our ratings methodology with a critical mass of members and confirmed its reliability, we will remove this preliminary data disclaimer from our site. </em></p>
<p>For tips about each rating, click on its title, or keep reading. For a detailed ratings breakdown, click on any of the star ratings (or click on &quot;Ratings&quot; in the report navbar). Since our members use different review forms, they don't get to see the same rating questions (the Quick Review form now has only six questions, while the Full Review form has twelve). Rating questions with no answers are not shown in the Overview, and left blank in the Ratings report.</p></p>
<p><a name="story_overall_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Recommendation</span>
<em>Q. Is it a good story?<br>
</em>This rating provides a first evaluation of this story, based on its overall quality. We ask this required question to all reviewers upfront, regardless of which review form they use. This overall rating is meant to indicate the reviewer's immediate response to story, so we can measure its overall popularity. Other questions in our review forms help reviewers reach beyond their initial impressions, by verifying this story's journalistic merits in more depth.</p>
<p><a name="story_accuracy"></a><a name="accurate_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Accuracy</span>
<em>Q. Is this story accurate</em><em>?</em><br>
Here we examine how closely the description of events and issues in this story matches reality, looking at its sources and the journalistic statements. How well do they square with our member's knowledge? with reports from other media? with our own research?   We ask members to only answer this question if they have sufficient knowledge of this topic. As a result, this question is often left blank, due to insufficient information.</p>
<p><a name="story_balance"></a><a name="important_viewpoints"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Balance</span>
<em>Q. Does this story present all key viewpoints?</em><br>
This rating probes whether one or more important sides to the event or issue are missing or given less space than they deserve. In general, the more perspectives a story includes, the fuller the picture of reality it provides. Note that most news stories only have room for the core arguments each side makes, rather than their complete point of view.</p>
<p><a name="story_context"></a><a name="big_picture"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Context</span>
<em>Q. Does this story show the "big picture"?</em><br>
This rating evaluates how well the story provides context by seeking answers to questions the public most needs to know about this issue or event. "Big picture" reporting that asks about causes, effects, solutions and trends, rather than describing a particular episode, such as a shooting, fire or accident, is also more helpful for this key sense-making function of news.</p>
<p><a name="story_evidence"></a><a name="factual_evidence"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Evidence</span>
<em>Q. Does this story provide factual evidence?</em><br>
This rating examines whether the authors of a story provide verifiable, factual evidence to support their assertions. We pay particular attention to whether the right sources are quoted (authoritative quotes, appropriate statistics, documents, etc.), especially in the headline and lead paragraphs (i.e., the principal generalizations the story makes). Documents and statistics often provide more compelling evidence for a generalization than statements by individuals. Multiple sources of evidence strengthen the support, as well as independent verification by the authors that this evidence is valid.</p>
<p><a name="story_fairness"></a><a name="fair_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Fairness</span>
<em>Q. Is this story fair?</em><br>
Journalists are expected to present fairly all sides of a controversy. Note this doesn't necessarily mean equal space for all sides. The space allotted to each side should be based on the evidence for its claims and its willingness to respond. Each relevant side, however, should be afforded the opportunity to make its core argument, or decline comment.</p>
<p><a name="story_importance"></a><a name="important_topic"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Importance</span>
<em>Q. Is this an important topic?</em><br>
This rating focuses on the importance of the topic or subject of the story, from the standpoint of informing citizens so they can participate in local, state and national government. Socially responsible journalism requires careful attention to what people in the community served need to know to make wise decisions, particularly collective (usually political) ones. Stories that provide what people want, but don't need to know, are less valuable because they are less empowering; they fail to provide what people need to know to be informed, active community participants. Stories covering topics such as the lives of celebrities, sports news, fender-benders and purely human interest stories generally are not as helpful to people in making sense of the world around them as are stories covering politics, government, education, crime, science, military actions, economics, social trends, etc. Another way we judge the importance of a story's topic is to ask how many people are affected by the topic of this story? tens? thousands? millions? billions?</p>
<p><a name="story_information"></a><a name="original_coverage"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Information</span>
<em>Q. Is this story informative?</em><br>
Here we evaluate the originality of this story's news coverage and/or interpretation. We ask our members whether the author is providing original information here, or merely repeating what others have written about this topic. To answer this question, we encourage reviewers to compare this story to other stories on the same topic.</p>
<p><a name="story_sources"></a><a name="identified_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Sources</span>
<em>Q. Is this story well sourced?</em><br>
This rating evaluates the level of care the authors take to find reliable sources for a story. We ask our member whether these sources are qualified to provide information based on special expertise, or unique knowledge of the facts. Expert sources whose view might not be influenced by a stake in the event or issue are particularly valuable; they help move reporting beyond "he said/she said" counterclaims that can leave readers confused. Additionally, we look at how the authors inform readers about where the information came from (clearly indicating and naming sources, explaining why a source may have been granted anonymity and providing some identifying information to help the reader/viewer assess credibility). As a rule, all sources should be named, including other news organizations. When a source cannot be named, readers are owed an explanation of why. Authors should also provide as much information short of identification to permit the reader to assess the credibility of an unnamed source. Readers have a right to know how the story was gathered, including any unconventional means. Surveys should indicate whether the approach was scientific &ndash; based on random selection of respondents &ndash; and describe the sample size, response rate, and if available, the margins of error.</p>
<p><a name="story_trust"></a><a name="credible_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Trust</span>
<em>Q. Do you trust this publication?</em><br>
This rating measures how much each reviewer trusts the source of this story (e.g., its authors and publication). We ask whether they find this news source credible, based on their experience. Can it be trusted to provide reliable information? We ask this subjective question upfront, because trust plays such an important role in how we perceive the news. Other questions in our review form help reviewers reach beyond their initial trust level, by verifying this source's journalistic integrity in more depth.</p>
<p><a name="story_style"></a><a name="clear_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Style</span>
<em>Q. Is this story well presented?</em><br>
The way a subject is treated also matters. This rating assesses the overall style and quality of the writing. We ask our reviewers whether the story is clear and easy to understand. Does it present useful information in an interesting way?  Does it make complex issues meaningful?  Does it explain unfamiliar terms and processes to the average reader? Does it inspire as well as inform?</p>
<p><a name="topic_knowledge"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Topic Knowledge</span>
<em>Q. Do you know about this topic?</em><br>
This member rating assesses how much our reviewers knew about this topic, before reading this story. How much information did they have on this subject? This knowledge could be specific to the event or issue, or more general (e.g., familiarity with similar topics).</p>
<p><a name="story_average_rating"></a><a name="weight_value"></a><a name="average_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Average Rating</span>
The average rating for a story is based on our members' answers to all rating questions in our review forms (e.g., recommendation, accuracy, balance, fairness). All answers are first weighted based on the importance of each rating question for that type of news. That first weighted average is then weighted again, taking into account each reviewer's own member rating, to determine a final, double-weighted rating for the reviewed story. This final average rating is shown next to the story title in our listings and story overview. Click on any star rating to see a detailed rating report for this story, broken down by category (see weight values at the bottom of that report).</p></p>
<p><a name="my_story_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">My Rating</span>
If you have already rated a story, your average rating for that story is shown as red stars in the story overview and rating report. This average story rating is based on your answers to all rating questions in our review forms (e.g., recommendation, accuracy, balance, fairness). Your answers are first weighted based on the importance of each rating question for that type of news. That first weighted average is then weighted again, taking into account your own member rating, in order to determine a final, double-weighted rating for the reviewed story. Note that you can change your story ratings at any time, by simply clicking on &quot;Review this Story&quot;. Your member rating is mostly determined by other members (though you can affect it a little with self-assessments questions such as Your Knowledge &ndash; see member ratings section).</p></p>
<p><a name="member_story_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Member Ratings</span>
A member's individual story ratings are shown as red stars in the story rating report. This average story rating is based on that member's answers to all rating questions in our review forms (e.g., recommendation, accuracy, balance, fairness). That member's answers are first weighted based on the importance of each rating question for that type of news. That first weighted average is then weighted again, taking into account the member rating for that individual, in order to determine a final, double-weighted rating for the reviewed story. Note that member ratings are mostly determined by other members (see member ratings section).</p></p>
<p><a name="review_form"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Review Forms</span>
A story review form is an online score pad where you can rate the quality of a story. We offer two different story review forms:  Quick Review and Full Review. We also offer a Mini Review in our Story Posting form. To open a review form,  click on &quot;Review this Story&quot; or &quot;Rate It&quot; on our site. <%=app_name%> resizes your browser window, and opens a new story window on the right.

<p><a name="tags"></a><a name="tag_story"></a><a name="story_tags" id="story_tags"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Story Tags</span>
The Tags section of a story report shows our member's tags (or keywords) for that story, as well as story stats, as described below. Tags can help identify stories by topic, media type, story location or political viewpoint. We offer several pre-defined tag menus, and also collect open-ended tags from our members. We encourage our reviewers to check these tags before they rate the story.</p>
<p>
For tips about each tag, click on its title, or keep reading. For a more detailed breakdown of story tags, click on   &quot;Tags&quot; in the report navbar. Since our members use different review forms, they don't all get to see tag questions. Unanswered tags are not shown in the Overview, and left blank in the Tags report.</p>
<p><a name="story_subject"></a><a name="story_topics"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Subjects / Topics</span>
Story reports feature key subjects and topic tags that relate to this story. We tag all stories by subject, in standard news categories such as: World, U.S., Politics, Business, Sci/Tech, Health, etc. For each subject area, we've selected some key topics that are of particular interest to our members. If this story matches any of the topics in our tag menu, we feature them in the story overview page. Click on any subject or topic tag to see a list of other stories for that topic. Our initial list of topics is growing rapidly, based on member requests. To submit a new Topic, click on the Topics tab in the top navigation bar of our site, then click &quot;Submit a Topic.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="story_formats"></a><a name="story_type"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Formats</span>
Story reports feature key format tags, such as story type and media type. Story types in our tag menu include: straight news report, special report, opinion, editorial, etc. Media types in our tag menu include: Blog, Magazine, Newspaper,  Online, TV, Radio,   Wire Service or Other. If a news story belongs in more than one category, we ask members to select the one it is best know for (e.g., CNN is best known as a TV network, even though it also has a popular online website). Click on any format tag to see a list of other stories for that format.</p>
<p><a name="story_location"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Location</span>
Story reports feature location tags to indicate where this story takes place. These include country, state, city or other primary location for this story.

We invite reviewers to write their own tags (or keywords) for the stories they review, to provide additional qualitative information about a story. Member tags include important people, places, events, objects and ideas mentioned in this story (example: george bush, white house, terrorism, privacy). We also encourage reviewers to identify newsmakers, sources and stakeholders for this story, as well as key organizations that play a role in this story. The most popular member tags are shown in the story overview page, and they are all listed in the Tags report page. Member tags are typed in an open-ended text field and are not spell-checked by <%=app_name%>. For consistency,  all member tags are converted to lower case.

<p><a name="story_stats" id="story_stats"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Story Stats</span>
The Stats section of a story report shows at a glance our member's average measurements of that story's contents. Story statistics can provide telltale signs of a story's journalistic quality, by identifying possible strengths and weaknesses based on quantitative analysis. For example, we can flag possible reporting flaws by counting the number of anonymous sources or derogatory words in a story. Conversely, a story with a high count of sources, viewpoints and quoted stakeholders could indicate sound journalistic methodology. These stats cannot be automatically translated into ratings, as they all need to be interpreted in context. But we encourage our reviewers to consider these key measurements while they rate the story.</p>
<p>
For tips about each stat, click on its title, or keep reading. For more detailed story stats, click on   &quot;Tags&quot; in the report navbar. Since our members use different review forms, they don't all get to see stat questions. Stat questions with no answers are not shown in the Overview, and left blank in the Tags report.</p>
<p><a name="number_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Number of Sources</span>
<em>Q. How many unique sources are quoted in this story?</em><br>
We count the total number of unique sources quoted in the story, whether they are named or unnamed (anonymous). If a source is quoted more than once, we only count it once.</p>
<p><a name="anonymous_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Anonymous Sources</span>
<em>Q. How many unnamed sources are quoted in this story?</em><br>
We count the total number of unique 'unnamed' or anonymous sources quoted in the story. Those are sources that are not identified by the full name of the individual or organization being quoted. If an unnamed source is quoted more than once, we only count it once. We count unnamed sources referred to in the plural (e.g., &ldquo;critics,&rdquo; &ldquo;Democrats,&rdquo; &ldquo;observers,&rdquo; etc.) as if it was one source.</p>
<p><a name="number_viewpoints"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Number of Viewpoints</span>
<em>Q. How many viewpoints are presented in this story?</em><br>
We count the number of unique viewpoints presented by the author in the story. If the same exact viewpoint is repeated in the story, we only count it once.</p>

<em>Q. How many stakeholders are mentioned in this story?</em><br>
We count the number of unique stakeholders (or interest groups) who were mentioned in the story. Stakeholders are different from viewpoints in that distinct groups might share an opinion on a subject, though they arrived from a different starting place. Teachers and students, for instance, might largely agree on a school controversy, though they are clearly different stakeholders with different interests. If the same interest group or stakeholder is mentioned several times in the story, we only count it once. If multiple members of the same group are mentioned, we count them as only one interest group.</p>
<p><a name="stakeholders_quoted"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Stakeholders Quoted</span>
<em>Q. How many of these stakeholders were consulted for this story?</em><br>
We count the number of stakeholders (or interest groups) who were consulted for the story. If multiple members of the same group are consulted or interviewed, we count them as only one interest group.</p>
<p><a name="derogatory_words"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Derogatory Words</span>
<em>Q. How many times does the author use derogatory words?</em><br>

<p><a name="complimentary_words"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Complimentary Words</span>
<em>Q. How many times does the author use complimentary words?</em><br>
We count the number of complimentary words or phrases used by the authors in the story (not including words in quotations).

<p><a name="how_to_find_source_report"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">How do I find a source report?</span>
If we have prepared a report on a news source, its name appears in bold in our source listings. To find the news sources we've reviewed to date, click on "Sources" in the top navbar of our site, then select the category of your choice. Click on any linked source name to see its source report. This takes you to our report's Overview page, which will present our findings about this source (also called &quot;About this Source &quot;).</p>
<p><a name="source_listing_by_medium"></a><a name="source_listing_by_subject"></a><a name="source_listing_by_politics"></a><a name="source_listing_alphabetical"></a><a name="what_is_source_listing"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What is a source listing?</span>
A source listing is a ranked list of news sources, based on their average source rating. We typically list sources by category. (e.g. blogs or newspapers). Most listed sources have a Source Report, which you can read by clicking on their source name. In order to be listed, a source has to receive a minimum number of story reviews, which is periodically adjusted, based on the average number of reviews per source on our site.</p>
<p><a name="how_we_pick_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">How do you pick which sources to feature on the <%=app_name%> site?</span>
Sources with the highest average ratings are automatically listed in ranked order on our source listing pages, by broad categories. Over time, we will start listing best and worst sources by sub-categories (e.g., best & worst liberal blogs, best & worst local TV news, etc.). We will also feature more prominently sources that have received more reviews and/or host recommendations.</p>
<p><a name="favorite_source"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">What if I don't see my favorite news source in <%=app_name%>?</span>
If we're missing a news source that we should be covering, please post a story from that source. To post a story, see our <%= link_to 'Reviewer FAQ', "/help/faq/reviewer/" + (params[:popup] ? "?popup=true" : "") %>. Once a news source has a sufficient number of reviews, it will start appearing in ranked order in its appropriate source listing. Be patient, as this process can take a while, and be sure to rate often. You can speed up this process by signing up a <a href="#host_signup">host</a> for your favorite source.</p>
<p><a name="source_ratings"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">How are source ratings calculated?</span>
Source ratings (shown as yellow squares) are the standard average of all story ratings for a given news source. All stories on the <%=app_name%> site are rated for journalistic quality, on a scale of one to five stars. A one-star rating means very bad journalism and a five &ndash;star rating means very good journalism, according to our reviewers. A detailed explanation of our rating system is provided below.</p>

<p><a name="check_source"></a><a name="source_report"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Source Report</span>
A source report is an online scorecard that presents our findings about a news source. Each source on our site has a Source Report, which is available to all members and can be read by clicking any source name. This takes you to our report's Overview page (also called &quot;About this Source&quot;). There, you can see a short summary about this source, along with our report's key findings.</p>
<p>
Each Source Report page has a gray action bar below the main summary, which lets you check the source website, see its story reviews or edit its report. To view the source website, click on &quot;View&quot; in the gray action bar. To review this source, click on &quot;Story Reviews&quot; in the gray action bar, then click on &quot;Review It&quot; for the story of your choice (see <a href="/help/faq/reviewer/" target="_blank">Reviewer FAQ</a>).

<p><a name="source_name"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Source Name</span>
Each Source Report begins with a source name, at the top of the page. This is the short name most commonly used by the public to refer to this source. Note that we typically do not include &quot;The&quot; in front of a source name, to avoid clutter in our source listings.</p>
<p><a name="source_media_main"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Media Type</span>
The main media type for this source is shown at the top of every source report. Options for this field include: Blog, Magazine, Newspaper, TV, Radio, Online, Wire Service or Other. This source is also listed under that category in <%=app_name%> listings.</p>
<p><a name="source_ownership"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Source Ownership</span>
<%=app_name%> provides separate listings for "mainstream" and "independent" news sources, to address a growing public concern about the trend toward public ownership and consolidation of the news media &ndash; often referred to as "mainstream media" (or "MSM"). Many observers worry that such "mainstream media" companies are no longer tied to community, they were now beholden to the demands of Wall Street, where the value of the product a company makes is often purely a matter of money.</p>
<p>
For our purposes, a "mainstream media" source is a large news provider that  is primarily owned or or subsidized by one or more conglomerates or mass media networks. The owners or backers of a "mainstream" source usually reach a large audience (1 million people or more), and invest considerable resources in their news operations (e.g., 1,000 employees or more, or $10 million yearly income or more). Mainstream media sources are often owned by publicly traded corporations, and commercial in nature, though not always. <%=app_name%> tags certain large news providers as "mainstream" even if they are owned by religious, political, governmental or nonprofit organizations; we consider that such ownership can significantly influence their news coverage, and jeopardize their independence; and because of their sheer size, they can also be subject to the same market forces that influence commercial conglomerates.</p>
<p>
An "independent media" source is a smaller news provider that is not a part of or a subsidiary of a larger mainstream conglomerate. For example, bloggers, alternative newspapers, community sites or non-profit organizations would typically be viewed as "independent media" sources for our purposes. "Independent media" sources are often perceived as free from the influence of commercial interests, and more representative of individual viewpoints, or viewpoints from ethnic groups, affinity groups or sub-cultures. In practice, some independent media sources can sometimes be influenced by larger organizations, such as religious, political, governmental or cultural groups. But as long as they are not primarily owned or subsidized by such large organizations, we consider them to be "independent."</p>
<p><a name="source_type_main"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Source Type</span>
The Source Report also features the main source type for this item. Options include: Publication, Distributor, Author,  Owner, Newsmaker or Other. If you're not sure what to select, ask yourself what this source is best know for. Over time, we will offer more source types, with different forms for each type.</p>
<p><a name="check_website"></a><a name="source_url_main"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">View</span>
To see the website of the source featured in a report, click on &quot;View &quot; next to its source type, or in the source action bar.

<p><a name="source_online_access"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Online Access</span>
Many large news sources now offer full online access to their news content, but some offer only limited access.

<p><a name="my_source_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">My Rating</span>
If you have already rated a story from this source, your average rating for that source is shown as red squares in the source overview. This average source rating is based on your answers to all rating questions in our story review forms (e.g., recommendation, accuracy, balance, fairness). Your answers are first weighted based on the importance of each rating question for that type of news. That first weighted average is then weighted again, taking into account your own member rating, in order to determine a second, double-weighted rating for the reviewed story. Lastly, this second average rating for each story is then averaged with all other story ratings from you for that source, in order to determine a final quality rating from you for that source. Your final source rating is shown in red next to the source name in our listings and source overview. In future versions of this site, we will let you click on your red square source rating to see your detailed rating report for that source. Note that you can change your ratings at any time, by going back to the stories you have reviewed, and clicking on &quot;Review this Story. &quot; Your member rating is mostly determined by other members (though you can affect it a little with self-assessments questions such as Your Knowledge &ndash; see member ratings section).</p></p>
<p><a name="source_overall_rating"></a><a name="source_overall_quality"></a><a name="overall_quality"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Recommendation *</span>
<em>Q. Is it a good story?<br>
</em>This rating provides a first evaluation of this story, based on its overall quality. We ask this required question to all reviewers upfront, regardless of which review form they use. This overall rating is meant to indicate the reviewer's immediate response to story, so we can measure its overall popularity. Other questions in our review forms help reviewers reach beyond their initial impressions, by verifying this story's journalistic merits in more depth.</p>
<p><a name="source_trust"></a><a name="source_credible_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Trust</span>
<em>Q. Do you trust this publication?</em><br>
This rating measures how much each reviewer trusts this publication. We ask our members whether they find this publication credible, based on their experience. Can it be trusted to provide reliable information? We ask this subjective question upfront, because trust plays such an important role in how we perceive the news. Other questions in our review forms help reviewers reach beyond their initial trust level, by verifying this source's journalistic integrity in more depth.</p>
<p><a name="trust_source"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">My Trust Rating</span>
<em>Q. Do you trust this publication?</em><br>
Your "Trust Rating" measures how much you personally trust this publisher. Based on your experience, is this publication credible? Can it be trusted to provide reliable information? Whatever you answer here will be filled in for all stories you review from this publication. We ask this subjective question upfront, because trust plays such an important role in how we perceive the news. If your initial trust level changes for this publication, you are welcome to come back and adjust this rating.</p>
<p><a name="source_accuracy"></a><a name="source_accurate_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Accuracy</span>
<em>Q. Is this story accurate</em><em>?</em><br>
Here we examine how closely the description of events and issues in stories from this source matches reality, looking at their sources and journalistic statements. How well do they square with our members' knowledge? with reports from other media? with our own research?   We ask members to only answer this question if they have sufficient knowledge of a story's topic. As a result, this question is often left blank, due to insufficient information.</p>
<p><a name="source_balance"></a><a name="source_important_viewpoints"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Balance</span>
<em>Q. Does it present all key viewpoints?</em><br>
This rating probes whether one or more important sides to the event or issue are missing or given less space than they deserve in stories from this source. In general, the more perspectives a story includes, the fuller the picture of reality it provides. Note that most news stories only have room for the core arguments each side makes, rather than their complete point of view.</p>
<p><a name="source_context"></a><a name="source_big_picture"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Context</span>
<em>Q. Does it show the "big picture"?</em><br>
This rating evaluates how well the source provides context by seeking answers to questions the public most needs to know about this issue or event. "Big picture" reporting that asks about causes, effects, solutions and trends, rather than describing a particular episode, such as a shooting, fire or accident, is also more helpful for this key sense-making function of news.</p>
<p><a name="source_evidence"></a><a name="source_factual_evidence"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Evidence</span>
<em>Q. Does it provide factual evidence?</em><br>
This rating examines whether this source provides verifiable, factual evidence to support its assertions. We pay particular attention to whether the right sources are quoted (authoritative quotes, appropriate statistics, documents, etc.), especially in the headline and lead paragraphs (i.e., the principal generalizations each story makes). Documents and statistics often provide more compelling evidence for a generalization than statements by individuals. Multiple sources of evidence strengthen the support, as well as independent verification by the authors that this evidence is valid.</p>
<p><a name="source_fairness"></a><a name="source_fair_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Fairness</span>
<em>Q. Is this story fair?</em><br>
Journalists are expected to present fairly all sides of a controversy. Note this doesn't necessarily mean equal space for all sides. The space allotted to each side should be based on the evidence for its claims and its willingness to respond. Each relevant side, however, should be afforded the opportunity to make its core argument, or decline comment.</p>
<p><a name="source_importance"></a><a name="source_important_topic"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Importance</span>
<em>Q. Does it cover important topics?</em><br>
This rating focuses on the importance of the topic or subject of each story from this source, from the standpoint of informing citizens so they can participate in local, state and national government. Socially responsible journalism requires careful attention to what people in the community served need to know to make wise decisions, particularly collective (usually political) ones. Stories that provide what people want, but don't need to know, are less valuable because they are less empowering; they fail to provide what people need to know to be informed, active community participants. Stories covering topics such as the lives of celebrities, sports news, fender-benders and purely human interest stories generally are not as helpful to people in making sense of the world around them as are stories covering politics, government, education, crime, science, military actions, economics, social trends, etc. Another way we judge the importance of a story's topic is to ask how many people are affected by the topic of this story: tens? thousands? millions? billions?</p>
<p><a name="source_information"></a><a name="source_original_coverage"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Information</span>
<em>Q. Is this story informative?</em><br>
Here we evaluate the originality of this source's news coverage and/or interpretation. We ask our members whether the author is providing original information in the stories they review from this source, or merely repeating what others have written about this topic. To answer this question, we encourage reviewers to compare stories from this source to other stories on related topics.</p>
<p><a name="source_sources"></a><a name="source_identified_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Sources</span>
<em>Q. Is this story well sourced?</em><br>
This rating evaluates the level of care the authors take to find reliable sources for a story. We ask our member whether these sources are qualified to provide information based on special expertise, or unique knowledge of the facts. Expert sources whose view might not be influenced by a stake in the event or issue are particularly valuable; they help move reporting beyond "he said/she said" counterclaims that can leave readers confused. Additionally, we look at how the authors inform readers about where the information came from (clearly indicating and naming sources, explaining why a source may have been granted anonymity and providing some identifying information to help the reader/viewer assess credibility). As a rule, all sources should be named, including other news organizations. When a source cannot be named, readers are owed an explanation of why. Authors should also provide as much information short of identification to permit the reader to assess the credibility of an unnamed source. Readers have a right to know how the source was gathered, including any unconventional means. Surveys should indicate whether the approach was scientific &ndash; based on random selection of respondents &ndash; and describe the sample size, response rate, and if available, the margins of error.</p>
<p><a name="source_style"></a><a name="source_clear_story"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Style</span>
<em>Q. Is this story well presented?</em><br>
The way a subject is treated also matters. This rating assesses the overall style and quality of the writing in stories from this source. We ask our reviewers whether these stories are clear and easy to understand. Do they present useful information in an interesting way? Do they make complex issues meaningful? Do they explain unfamiliar terms and processes to the average reader? Do they inspire as well as inform?</p>
<p><a name="source_weight_value"></a><a name="source_average_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Average Rating</span>
The average rating for a source is based on our members' answers to all rating questions in our story review forms (e.g., recommendation, accuracy, balance, fairness). All answers are first weighted based on the importance of each rating question for that type of news. That first weighted average is then weighted again, taking into account each reviewer's own member rating, to determine a second, double-weighted rating for each reviewed story from that source. Lastly, this second average rating for each story is then averaged with all other story ratings from that source, in order to determine a final quality rating for that source. That final source rating is shown in yellow next to the source name in our listings and source overview. In future versions of this site, you will be able to click on any square rating to see a detailed rating report for this source, broken down by category.</p>
<p><a name="member_source_rating"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Member Ratings</span>
A member's individual source rating is shown as red squares in a source's overview page. This average source rating is based on that member's answers to all rating questions in our story review forms (e.g., recommendation, accuracy, balance, fairness). That member's answers are first weighted based on the importance of each rating question for that type of news. That first weighted average is then weighted again, taking into account the member rating for that individual, in order to determine a second, double-weighted rating for the reviewed story. Lastly, this second average rating for each story is then averaged with all other story ratings from that member for source, in order to determine a final quality rating from that member for that source. That final source rating is shown in red next to the source name in our listings and source overview. Note that member ratings are mostly determined by other members (see member ratings section).</p></p>
<p><a name="source_topic_knowledge"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Topic Knowledge</span>
<em>Q. Do you know about this topic?</em><br>
This member self-rating assesses how much our reviewers knew about the topic of stories they review, before reading them. How much information did they have on this subject? This knowledge could be specific to the event or issue, or more general (e.g., familiarity with similar topics).</p>
<p><a name="story_review_form"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Story Review Forms</span>
A story review form is an online score pad where you can rate the quality of a story. To rate a source in the current beta site, you need to review one of its stories, using one of our review forms. We offer two different story review forms:  Quick Review and Full Review. We also offer a Mini Review in our Story Posting form. To open a story review form,  click on &quot;Review this Story&quot; or &quot;Rate It&quot; on our beta site. <%=app_name%> resizes your browser window, and opens a new story window on the right.

<p><a name="tag_source"></a><a name="source_tags"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Source Tags</span>
The Tags section of a source report shows our member's tags (or keywords), as well as story stats for that source as described below. Tags can help identify stories and sources by topic, media type, source location or political viewpoint. We offer both source tags and story tags, collected either from pre-defined tag menus, or from open-ended story tags from our members. We encourage our reviewers to check these tags before they rate a story.</p>

<p><a name="source_stats"></a><span class="subhead_italic">Source Stats</span>
The Stats section of a source report shows at a glance our member's average measurements of that source's contents. Source statistics can provide telltale signs of a source's journalistic quality, by identifying possible strengths and weaknesses based on quantitative analysis. For example, we can flag possible reporting flaws by counting the number of anonymous sources or derogatory words in a source. Conversely, a source with a high count of sources, viewpoints and quoted stakeholders could indicate sound journalistic methodology. These stats cannot be automatically translated into ratings, as they all need to be interpreted in context. But we encourage our reviewers to consider these key measurements while they rate the source.</p>
<p>
For tips about each stat, click on its title, or keep reading. For more detailed source stats, click on   &quot;Tags&quot; in the report navbar. Since our members use different review forms, they don't all get to see stat questions. Stat questions with no answers are not shown in the Overview, and left blank in the Tags report.</p>
<p><a name="source_unique_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Number of Sources</span>
<em>Q. How many unique sources are quoted per story?</em><br>
We count the total number of unique sources quoted in each story, whether they are named or unnamed (anonymous). If a source is quoted more than once, we only count it once.</p>
<p><a name="source_anonymous_sources"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Anonymous Sources</span>
<em>Q. How many unnamed sources are quoted per story?</em><br>
We count the total number of unique 'unnamed' or anonymous sources quoted in each story. Those are sources that are not identified by the full name of the individual or organization being quoted. If an unnamed source is quoted more than once, we only count it once. We count unnamed sources referred to in the plural (e.g., &ldquo;critics,&rdquo; &ldquo;Democrats,&rdquo; &ldquo;observers,&rdquo; etc.) as if it was one source.</p>
<p><a name="source_unique_viewpoints"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Number of Viewpoints</span>
<em>Q. How many viewpoints are presented per story?</em><br>
We count the number of unique viewpoints presented by the author in each story. If the same exact viewpoint is repeated in the story, we only count it once.</p>

<em>Q. How many stakeholders are mentioned per story?</em><br>
We count the number of unique stakeholders (or interest groups) who were mentioned in each story. Stakeholders are different from viewpoints in that distinct groups might share an opinion on a subject, though they arrived from a different starting place. Teachers and students, for instance, might largely agree on a school controversy, though they are clearly different stakeholders with different interests. If the same interest group or stakeholder is mentioned several times in a story, we only count it once. If multiple members of the same group are mentioned, we count them as only one interest group.</p>

<em>Q. How many of these stakeholders are consulted per story?</em><br>
We count the number of stakeholders (or interest groups) who were consulted for each story. If multiple members of the same group are consulted or interviewed, we count them as only one interest group.</p>
<p><a name="source_derogatory_words"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Derogatory Words</span>
<em>Q. How many times do the authors use derogatory words?</em><br>
We count the number of derogatory words or phrases used by the authors in each story (not including words in quotations). We look for overly negative words or phrases that inappropriately discredit an individual or organization, to support a author's opinion.</p>
<p><a name="source_complimentary_words"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">Complimentary Words</span>
<em>Q. How many times do the authors use complimentary words?</em><br>
We count the number of complimentary words or phrases used by the authors in each story (not including words in quotations).

Please write in the subject of your email the type of problem you are reporting (technical bug, duplicate story, factual error, incomplete review, offensive comment, abusive member, or questions about your account). Then describe your problem in as much detail as possible. To help us better serve you, please include in your email message the full web address of the page you are reporting a problem for, as well as any special codes inserted by <%=app_name%> when you clicked the "Report a Problem" link.</p>
<p><a name="suggestions"></a><span class="subhead_plain_bold">I have suggestions for how <%=app_name%> can be improved. Who can I tell?</span>
We're always interested in hearing from our members, as we're constantly testing and improving <%=app_name%>. So please do let us know what you think is and isn't working. A good place to do that for now is in our Suggestions comment thread, which you can join at anytime by clicking "Suggestions" in the left sidebar. Or you can email them to us at <%= mail_to email_addr("suggestions"), email_addr("suggestions"), :subject => "#{app_name} suggestions", :encode => "javascript" %>.</p>
