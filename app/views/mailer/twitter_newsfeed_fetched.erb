Dear <%=@member.first_name%>,

Thanks for adding your Twitter Feed to your account on <%=app_name%>.

Your Twitter News Feed has been fetched successfully!

You can now view news links posted by you and people you follow on Twitter on this public Feed page:
<%=feed_url(@feed)%>.

Some of these stories from Twitter will also appear on your own MyNews page:
<%="#{home_url}mynews"%>

(the number and order of stories depends on what other items you are following on MyNews)

Going forward, <%=app_name%> will fetch your Twitter News Feed every couple hours (but we won't be emailing you every time).  To see the latest stories, visit your MyNews page -- or your Twtiter Feed page, at the links above. We recommend you bookmark these pages for regular use.

To stop following your Facebook Feed on <%=app_name%>, either go to your MyNews page or click here:
<%=twitter_unfollow_newsfeed_url%>

Please email us at <%=SocialNewsConfig["email_addrs"]["feedback"]%> if you have any questions -- and visit the MyNews FAQ for helpful tips on this new service:
<%="#{home_url}help/faq/mynews#add_feeds"%>

Enjoy!


The <%=app_name%> Team
