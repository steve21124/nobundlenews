Dear <%=@member.first_name%>,

Thanks for adding your Facebook Feed to your account on <%=app_name%>.

Your Facebook News Feed has been fetched successfully!

You can now view news links posted by your Facebook Friends on this private Feed page:
<%=feed_url(@feed)%>.

Please note that this page is only visible to you, and only when you are logged in, to protect your privacy.

Some of these stories from Facebook will also appear on your own MyNews page:
<%="#{home_url}mynews"%>

(the number and order of stories depends on what other items you are following on MyNews)

Going forward, <%=app_name%> will fetch your Facebook News Feed every couple hours (but we won't be emailing you every time).  To see the latest stories, visit your MyNews page -- or your Facebook Feed page, at the links above. We recommend you bookmark these pages for regular use.

To stop following your Facebook Feed on <%=app_name%>, either go to your MyNews page or click here:
<%=fb_unfollow_newsfeed_url%>

Please email us at <%=SocialNewsConfig["email_addrs"]["feedback"]%> if you have any questions -- and visit the MyNews FAQ for helpful tips on this new service:
<%="#{home_url}help/faq/mynews#add_feeds"%>

Enjoy!


The <%=app_name%> Team
