GENERAL

BUGS
----
* Whenever topic relationships are modified, all story taggings would
  have to be updated automatically as well.

* Sigh! why aren't member ratings initialized to zero?
  Make sure default initial value for member ratings is zero.

* In app/views/mailer/send_to_friend/story.erb, we have a bug for
  source pages on local sites!  This will use national site rating.

* when taxonomies are updated, they only update on the master rather
  than update on all servers (till the next day when the update task
  runs on both servers).

* the story page that displays reviews and ratings should only show count
  of public reviews.

TODO: testing
-------------
. auto subject tagging
. bad homepage topic params (should fail)
. srcs with high editorial priority should let stories through to listing, even if the src is 'untrusted'
  - on regular listings
  - as well as on source page listings for that source
. topics sidebar on feed pages should be rendered
. tests with expectations for local sites
. when tweet box is checked, review submit should not break
. when tweet box is checked, tweet it should work
. tests for posting limits on members
. verify that the client ip is correctly passed through (after we migrated over to rails 2.3)
. feed fetcher tests
. newsletter controller tests

RATINGS MODULE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS
----
* individual component rating for stories is buggy.  It uses standard average of
  all ratings from reviews, rather than weighted average across members.  The overall
  story rating is correct and is a member-level weighted average.

* 'overall rating' for sources includes story ratings from all stories, not just
  site specific stories.

* group ratings for stories doesn't use group ratings for sources which are yet
  to be properly set up.

TODO
----
* confidence rating for a story is not necessarily the right metric -- it needs to
  be rethought and recomputed.  This in turn will affect ratings for sources, etc.

* Strictly speaking, whenever you change your source review rating (either within
  a review, or on the source page or the rate your sources page), we would have
  to update ratings for all your reviews for that source (and then all their
  associated stories).  We have never been doing this so far, but presumably
  these kinds of changes are not very common.  This is not such a big deal since
  source review ratings only contributes 5% to the overall review rating (so,
  even a 4-point change in source review rating will lead to a 0.2 rating change
  for the review, and for a rated story, a max 0.07 rating change).

* rating recomputation for sources is excessive.  In general, is it possible to make
  recomputation of ratings (stories, sources) somewhat incremental?
