Controlling member privileges
-----------------------------
Member validation levels are used in many places in the code to control what
members can do and also as a way to limit damage from spammers and other
low-credibility accounts.  

Whenever a member registers on the site, they start with a validation level
of 1.  Since validation level is controlled by editors, editors can easily
control problem accounts.  

But, if you want to use other non-strict and community-based control for
problem accounts, use member ratings that can change through activity on the
site and through ratings by other members.

* Check can_post? and can_comment? methods in app/models/member.rb to see how
  validation levels are used.

* The minimum validation levels for different activities are controlled by
  settings in config/social_news_constants/member_constants.yml.  The default
  settings are:
  - posting requires validation level of 2
  - commenting requires validation level of 2

* CURRENTLY DISABLED: For a member with a photo to me displayed in the recent
  reviewers panel, we used to have a requirement for the member rating
  (not validation level) to be at least 2.  Additionally, for members
  without photos to be displayed in the recent reviewers panel on the homepage
  (not on other pages), we had a requirement for the member rating to be
  at least 2.  Check find_recent_reviewers in app/models/member.rb

Controlling story listings
--------------------------
Member validation levels and member rating values are also used to control the
quality of story listings on the site.  Check app/models/story_listing_helpers.rb

* mynews listing uses member validation level 
* activity listing (for editors/staff) uses member validation level
* trusted_reviews listing uses both member validation level and member ratings
* recent reviews listing uses member validation level
